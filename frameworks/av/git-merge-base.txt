    mtp: Define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to support 2~4G file
    
    File offset type "off_t" is a signed long integer, so the maximum
    offset is 2GB. If the file size is bigger than 2GB, the file offset
    will be type-cast to a negative number. And it will cause a file is
    limited to 2GB or MTP transmission break.
    
    Test: manual - connect Android device to Windowns PC
    Test: manual - select MTP/File Transfer in android device
    Test: manual - copy a file which is bigger than 2GB from Windowns PC to
                   the android device.
