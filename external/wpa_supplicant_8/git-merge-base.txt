    P2P: Fix copying of secondary device types for P2P group client
    
    Parsing and copying of WPS secondary device types list was verifying
    that the contents is not too long for the internal maximum in the case
    of WPS messages, but similar validation was missing from the case of P2P
    group information which encodes this information in a different
    attribute. This could result in writing beyond the memory area assigned
    for these entries and corrupting memory within an instance of struct
    p2p_device. This could result in invalid operations and unexpected
    behavior when trying to free pointers from that corrupted memory.
